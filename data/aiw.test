why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore two lines
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first
would you like to see a little of it
don t be impertinent said the king and don t look at me like that
twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop
it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves
i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i
how can you learn lessons in here
have you guessed the riddle yet
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
never heard of uglifying
it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare
she pitied him deeply
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence
she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot
said the lory hastily
said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
chorus
same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back
mary ann
there s no pleasing them
in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple
then it ought to be number one said alice
well
alice ventured to ask
alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home
and how odd the directions will look
i thought it would said the cat and vanished again
if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose
so she went in search of her hedgehog
even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause
you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
that s right
there was a dead silence
he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them
why
and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke
no i give it up alice replied what s the answer
alice was silent
however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more
the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day
she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again
call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness
treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
muttered the hatter
said the caterpillar
some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesn t suit my throat
